89 : An high level overview of javascript

- Javascript is a high level object oriented, multi paradigm programming language.

---------------
- High Level : 
    Any computer program needs resources
    C = Low-level language ( Developer has to manage resources manually)
    Python, Javascript = High-level language ( Developer does not have to worry, everything happens automatically)

- Garbage-collected : 
    Cleaning the memory so we don't have to
    (Kind of like cleaning guide so we don't have to manually clean the memory we don't need)

- Interpreted or just in time compiled :
    Everything program is translated to 0 and 1, aka machine code
    We simply write javascript code and is translated(machine code).
    This can be done either interpreted or compiling.

- Multi-paradigm :
    Paradigm is an approach and an overall mindset of structuring our code
    1 ) Procedural programming
    2 ) Object-oriented programming(OOP)
    3 ) Functional programming

- Prototype based object oriented :
    Everything in javascript is object, except for primitive values, except numbers, strings and etc
    Arrays is an object

- First class functions
    Functions are simply treated as variables. we can pas them into other functions, and return them from functions.

- Dynamic
    No data type definitions. Type becomes known at runtime.
    Data type of variable is automatically changed
